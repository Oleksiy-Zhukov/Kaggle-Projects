# Data Science Projects
This repository contains a collection of my Data Science projects originally done on Kaggle. Each project has its own directory within this repo, and a brief description can be found in their respective README files.

# Projects

#### [Digit Recognition](https://github.com/Oleksiy-Zhukov/Kaggle-Projects/tree/main/Digit-Recognition) (March 2023): 
- This project focuses on building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits. It involves exploring the famous MNIST dataset and training various classification algorithms.
- The trained model achieved an accuracy of 99.52% on the testing set, which is a state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset.

#### [House Prices](https://github.com/Oleksiy-Zhukov/Kaggle-Projects/tree/main/House-Prices) (March 2023):
- In this project, I analyze a dataset of housing prices and develop a regression model to predict the prices of new houses based on their features. I explore various data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and model selection.
- My last model ensemble achieved RMSE of 0.119 on the testing dataset, which placed me in the top 4% of the Kaggle House Prices Competition leaderboard.

Matplotlib: This project showcases different data visualization techniques using Matplotlib. I demonstrate how to create various plots, charts, and graphs to effectively communicate insights from data.

Superstore Analysis: Here, I analyze a fictional superstore dataset to gain insights into its sales, customers, and products. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to identify patterns and trends.

Titanic: This project is centered around the Titanic dataset, aiming to predict the survival of passengers based on various features. I explore feature engineering, model training, and evaluation techniques to build a predictive model.
