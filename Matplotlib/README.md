# Kaggle Notebook | Matplotlib Common Plot Types

This project provides simple examples of some of the most popular charts from the matplotlib library, including bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots. The charts are styled with my custom design, and I've used seaborn for simple formatting. By exploring these examples, users can gain a better understanding of how to create effective data visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Matplotlib python library (https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
* Seaborn python library (https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)

### Usage

This project is contained within a single Jupyter Notebook file called KaggleNotebook.ipynb, which can be found either in this repository or on my Kaggle page ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhukovoleksiy/matplotlib-common-plot-types/notebook)). By opening the notebook, you can view all of the code and its corresponding results in a single page. Simply scroll through the notebook to explore the examples and see the visualizations.
