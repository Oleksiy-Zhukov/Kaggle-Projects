# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Notebook

## Description

In this project, I participated in the Kaggle House Prices Competition to create a regression model with the lowest root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) between the predicted and actual sale prices. I used the provided training dataset to develop a model that can accurately predict the sale prices of homes in the testing dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have a Kaggle account and download the dataset from the competition website. You can find the dataset here.

The project was implemented using Python, and the following Python libraries were used:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - for data manipulation and analysis
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - for numerical computations and array operations
* [plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/) - for data visualization
* [scipy](https://scipy.org/) - for statistical analysis
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - for building and evaluating machine learning models
* [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - for building gradient boosted trees
* [lightgbm](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.2/) - for building gradient boosting framework
* [catboost](https://catboost.ai/en/docs/) - for building gradient boosting model
* [mlxtend](https://pypi.org/project/mlxtend/) - for machine learning extensions and additional functionality
* [warnings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) - for handling warning messages generated by the models
* [kaleido](https://pypi.org/project/kaleido/) - for exporting static images of the visualizations 

Once you have downloaded the dataset and installed the necessary libraries, you can run the notebook in a Jupyter environment or any other Python environment of your choice. The notebook contains detailed instructions and explanations on how to use the different libraries and techniques to build and evaluate regression models. Note that if you want to export static images of the visualizations created using plotly, you will need to have kaleido installed.

You can also find the Kaggle Notebook for this project [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhukovoleksiy/house-prices-detailed-top-5-solution). Note that you will need to have a Kaggle account to access the Notebook.

## Approach

To tackle this problem, I analyzed the features provided in the dataset, understood their meanings, and identified any missing or incomplete data. I also investigated the relationships between the different features and their correlations with the sale prices. By doing this, I gained insights into which features are most important in predicting the sale prices and developed a strategy for feature engineering and selection.

The main regression models I used were Lasso and Ridge regressions, which work well with big amounts of features and prevent overfitting. Additionally, I tested other regression models such as XGBoost Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, and LGBMRegressor, to see how they compared to the Lasso and Ridge regressions on the House Prices dataset.

Once I tested all of the regression models, I blended them together to create a final model using a weighted average approach. I also trained a meta model StackingCVRegressor optimizer using CatBoostRegressor.

## Results

My most recent model achieved a RMSE of 0.119 on the testing dataset, which placed me in the top 4% of the Kaggle House Prices Competition leaderboard.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project showcases my approach to solving the Kaggle House Prices Competition using a variety of regression models and feature engineering techniques. I hope this notebook can be useful for anyone interested in this competition or in regression modeling in general.
